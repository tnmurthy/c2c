"""Façade for the profile graph layer.

The implementation is split across focused modules:

- profile_base         shared primitives + low-level Kùzu/vector I/O wrappers
- profile_deletions    soft-delete tombstones + read-path deletion filtering
- profile_vectors      LanceDB read/write/embed + per-entity embedding text
- profile_read         profile read/merge + snapshot load/save/refresh
- profile_correlations bulk maintenance: purge / vector-sync / rebuild
- profile_mutations    create/update/delete + edge-linking + materialize

This module re-exports their public API so existing
`from data.graph.profile import X` imports keep working unchanged.
